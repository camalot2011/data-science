## Part 1: Factorial Function

The objective of Part 1 is to write a function that computes the factorial of an integer greater than or equal to 0. Recall that the factorial of a number n is n * (n-1) * (n - 2) * . * 1. The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1. Before taking on this part of the assignment, you may want to review the section on Functional Programming in this course.
```{r part1, echo=TRUE}
library(purrr)

factorial_loop <- function(n) {
  stopifnot(n>=0)
  ans = 1
  if(n==0){
      ans
  } else for(i in 1:n){
      ans <- ans*i
  }
  return(ans)
}

factorial_reduce <- function(n){
  stopifnot(n>=0)
  if(n==0){return(1)}
  else return(reduce(1:n,function(x,y){x*y}))
}

factorial_func <- function(n){
  stopifnot(n>=0)
  if(n==0){return(1)}
  else return(n*factorial_func(n-1))
}

fac_table <- c(1,1,rep(NA,100))

factorial_mem <- function(n){
  stopifnot(n>=0)
  if(!is.na(fac_table[n+1])){
    return(fac_table[n+1])
  } else {
    fac_table[n] <<- factorial_mem(n-1)
    return(n*fac_table[n])
  }
}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
